  <ol class="rules">
    <li> At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up).</li>
    <li>You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color.</li>
    <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one.</li>
    <li>You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order.</li>
    <li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>
    <li>You need to repeat these three signals in the order.</li>
    <li>Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.</li>
    <li>Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.</li>
    <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 3 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound. That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.</li>
